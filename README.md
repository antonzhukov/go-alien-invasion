# Description

This is the simple game called Alien Invasion which is implemented in Go.

## Assumptions

1. If in the file there's a city A which has a road to city B, 
I assume that the city B also has the road to city A. 
2. There's only 1 road from city A to city B. For this I implemented neighbours uniqueness map.
